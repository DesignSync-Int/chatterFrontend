# Smart Notification System - Context-Aware Toast Management 🔔✨

## Overview

Chatter now features an intelligent notification system that **prevents annoying duplicate notifications** when users are actively engaged in conversations. This creates a much smoother and more intuitive user experience.

## 🧠 Smart Context Detection

### What It Does

The system automatically detects when a user is actively viewing a conversation and **suppresses toast notifications** for messages from that specific person, preventing notification spam.

### Detection Methods

#### 1. **Active Chat Window Detection** 💬

- Checks if user has an **open, non-minimized chat window** with the message sender
- No notifications when the conversation is visible on screen
- Notifications resume when chat window is closed or minimized

#### 2. **Selected User Context** 👤

- Tracks which user is currently selected/active in conversation
- Suppresses notifications from the actively selected conversation partner
- Maintains conversation flow without interruptions

#### 3. **Browser Tab Visibility** 🖥️

- Detects if the browser tab is **active and focused**
- Only suppresses notifications when user is actually viewing the app
- Shows notifications when user switches to other tabs/apps

## 🎯 Smart Logic Flow

```typescript
// Notification Decision Tree
if (messageFromSelf) {
  // Never show notifications for own messages
  return false;
}

if (selectedUser === messageSender) {
  // User is actively chatting with this person
  return false;
}

if (hasOpenChatWindow && isTabActive) {
  // Chat window is open and tab is focused
  return false;
}

// Show notification - user isn't actively viewing this conversation
return true;
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### **VisibilityManager** 👁️

- Singleton class managing browser visibility state
- Tracks tab visibility, window focus, and page state
- Provides React hooks for component integration

#### **Chat Windows Store** 🗂️

- Manages open chat windows and their states
- Tracks minimized/maximized state
- Provides context about active conversations

#### **Enhanced Auth Store** 🔐

- Updated message listener with smart logic
- Integrates with chat state and visibility detection
- Maintains user experience flow

### Key Features

#### **Real-time Context Awareness** ⚡

- Instant detection of conversation state changes
- No lag between opening chat and notification suppression
- Seamless user experience

#### **Multi-level Detection** 🎚️

- **Level 1**: Active conversation partner
- **Level 2**: Open chat window
- **Level 3**: Browser tab visibility
- **Level 4**: Window focus state

#### **Fallback Safety** 🛡️

- Always shows notifications when user isn't actively engaged
- Prevents missed messages from other contacts
- Maintains notification reliability

## 🚀 User Experience Benefits

### Before (Standard Behavior)

❌ **Annoying**: Toast notifications while actively chatting
❌ **Disruptive**: Popup covers conversation content
❌ **Redundant**: User already sees the message in chat
❌ **Distracting**: Breaks conversation flow

### After (Smart Behavior)

✅ **Seamless**: No interruptions during active conversations
✅ **Intuitive**: Notifications only when needed
✅ **Context-aware**: Understands user's current focus
✅ **Clean**: Uncluttered interface during chats

## 📱 Multi-Device & Multi-Tab Support

### Tab Switching

- **Active Tab**: Suppresses notifications for open chats
- **Background Tab**: Shows notifications to alert user
- **Window Switching**: Handles focus changes elegantly

### Conversation State

- **Chat Open**: No notifications from that person
- **Chat Minimized**: Notifications resume
- **Chat Closed**: Full notification behavior

## 🎨 Enhanced UX Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Active Conversation

```
User: Opens chat with ChatterBot
ChatterBot: Sends message → NO TOAST (user can see message)
Result: Clean, uninterrupted conversation flow
```

### Scenario 2: Background Activity

```
User: Switches to another tab
ChatterBot: Sends message → SHOWS TOAST (user needs alert)
Result: User knows there's a new message waiting
```

### Scenario 3: Multiple Chats

```
User: Chatting with Alice (active window)
Bob: Sends message → SHOWS TOAST (different conversation)
Alice: Sends message → NO TOAST (active conversation)
Result: Perfect context awareness
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Details

### Visibility Manager API

```typescript
// Check if tab is active
const isActive = visibilityManager.isTabActive();

// Subscribe to visibility changes
const unsubscribe = visibilityManager.onVisibilityChange((visible, focused) => {
  console.log(`Tab visibility: ${visible}, Focus: ${focused}`);
});

// React hook for components
const { isVisible, isFocused, isActive } = useTabVisibility();
```

### Chat Windows Integration

```typescript
// Check for open chat windows
const openChatWindow = chatWindowsStore.openChats.find(
  (chat) => chat.user._id === senderId && !chat.minimized
);
```

## 🎯 Future Enhancements
